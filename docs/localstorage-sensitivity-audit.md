# localStorage Sensitivity Audit

This document enumerates every localStorage key written by the ILN-Frontend codebase,
classifies the data stored in each, and identifies any privacy or security exposure under
a hypothetical XSS scenario (defense-in-depth, complementing the CSP work in Issue #16).

## Sensitive Key Analysis

### 1. `iln_wallet_address` — Stellar public key

**Risk level: LOW-MEDIUM**

The stored value is a Stellar *public* key — not a private key, seed, or signing
credential. Stellar public keys are already visible on-chain for any active account,
so exposure via XSS does not grant an attacker asset control. The wallet extension
(Freighter / WalletConnect) holds the private key in its own isolated storage and
never exposes it to page JavaScript.

**Accepted risk:** The address is stored for silent-reconnect convenience and wallet-
scoped cache lookups. An XSS attacker could read it, but the same address is
trivially observable on-chain for any funded account. No further mitigation needed
beyond the existing CSP.

### 2. `iln-notification-subscriptions` — email / webhook targets

**Risk level: MEDIUM**

The `target` field in subscription entries contains plaintext email addresses or
webhook URLs that the user explicitly opted into sharing.

**Mitigation already present:**
- Written only after explicit user opt-in via the notification settings UI.
- Cleared on wallet disconnect (not in `WALLET_SCOPED_PREFIXES`, but the key is
  non-wallet-specific and resets per browser profile).

**Accepted risk:** If XSS were present, the attacker could read these email
addresses. This is a privacy exposure but not a credential leak — the emails are
already shared with the ILN reminder service. The CSP (Issue #16) is the primary
mitigation layer for XSS prevention.

### 3. `iln-address-book-{walletAddress}` — wallet addresses + nicknames

**Risk level: LOW-MEDIUM**

Contains user-supplied nicknames mapped to Stellar addresses. The nicknames are
optional, user-provided PII (e.g. "Alice's Savings").

**Mitigation already present:**
- Scoped per wallet address; cleared on disconnect via `clearWalletStorage()`.
- Nicknames are voluntarily entered — the user accepts that they are stored locally.

**Accepted risk:** Nicknames are convenience labels, not credentials. Exposure via
XSS is a privacy concern but not a security one. The CSP remains the primary
defense.

### 4. `iln-lp-settings` — LP notification email

**Risk level: MEDIUM**

The `notificationPreferences.email` field stores the user's email in plaintext.

**Mitigation already present:**
- Written only after the user enters their email in the LP settings panel.
- Not wallet-scoped (persists across wallet switches).

**Accepted risk:** Same as subscription email — privacy exposure, not credential
leak. The email is already transmitted to the ILN backend for reminder delivery.

## Negative Findings (What Is NOT Stored)

The following sensitive categories are **never written to localStorage**:

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Private keys / seed phrases | **Not stored** — held exclusively by the wallet extension |
| Session tokens / JWTs | **Not stored** — wallet signing is handled by Freighter/WalletConnect in their own context; Supabase anon key is public by design |
| Transaction signing payloads | **Not stored** — passed in-memory only |
| On-chain invoice amounts / financial data | **Not stored** in localStorage (fetched from Soroban RPC / Horizon) |
| Supabase service role key | **Not stored** — server-only via `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` env var |
| WalletConnect session URI / pairing data | **Not stored** — managed by `@walletconnect/sign-client` internally |

---

## Disconnect Cleanup

`clearWalletStorage()` in `src/utils/walletStorage.ts` removes:

- `iln_wallet_address`
- `iln_wallet_provider`
- All keys prefixed with: `iln-address-book-`, `iln-watchlist`, `iln-referral-`,
  `iln-invoices-`, `iln-portfolio-`, `freelancerInvoices`

**Note:** The following keys persist across wallet disconnects (they are user-
preferences, not session data):
- `theme`, `freelancer_view_mode`, `iln-notification-subscriptions`,
  `iln-lp-settings`, `iln-sound-prefs`, `iln-bookmarks`, `iln_recent_commands`,
  `iln:last-seen-version`, `iln:dismissed-*`, `iln_invoice_reminders`,
  `iln_saved_invoice_filters`, `iln_lp_widget_layout_*`, `iln_table_config_*`,
  `iln_export_columns_*`, `iln_top_funders_30d`

This is intentional — these are cross-session UI preferences, not session-bound data.

## Conclusion

All 25 localStorage keys store non-sensitive UI preferences, layout state, or
public blockchain identifiers. The four keys flagged as sensitive (wallet address,
email addresses, address-book nicknames) contain data that is either already
public on-chain (wallet address) or voluntarily shared with the protocol backend
(emails for reminders). **No private keys, session tokens, or signing credentials
are ever persisted in localStorage.**

The primary XSS mitigation remains the Content Security Policy (Issue #16). This
audit confirms that even under a hypothetical XSS bypass, the attacker would gain
no ability to sign transactions or exfiltrate cryptographic secrets from localStorage.
