# Testing strategy

The repository uses a layered testing setup rather than a single test tool. Use the tool that matches the risk you are changing:

- Unit and integration tests with Vitest for utilities, hooks, and component behavior.
- Browser-level regression tests with Playwright for critical flows such as wallet connection, invoice workflows, governance, and responsive layouts.
- Accessibility checks with jest-axe for component-level accessibility regressions.
- Visual regression and UI documentation with Storybook plus Chromatic for high-risk components and design-system states.
- MSW to mock network responses where a real backend or contract node is unnecessary.

## When to use which tool

| Scenario                                               | Preferred tool        | Why                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pure logic, state hooks, or small component behavior   | Vitest                | Fast feedback, easy to run locally, and already used across `__tests__/` and `src/**/__tests__`. |
| Full user journey in a browser                         | Playwright            | Exercises real navigation and interaction across the app.                                        |
| Accessibility regressions for a component              | jest-axe              | Best fit for screen-reader and semantic HTML issues.                                             |
| UI consistency and visual diffs                        | Storybook + Chromatic | Lets contributors review component states and catch unintended styling changes.                  |
| API or contract responses that should be deterministic | MSW                   | Keeps tests isolated from external services and matches the current mock setup.                  |

## Test locations and conventions

### Vitest

Vitest suites live in the repository test folders and next to relevant source files:

- `__tests__/` for broader app-level, contract, and integration coverage.
- `src/**/__tests__/` for hooks, utilities, and focused component tests.

Run locally with:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch
```

### Playwright

End-to-end tests live under `e2e/` and should focus on the user flows that are too expensive to prove with unit tests alone. Run them with:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e
```

### Accessibility

Accessibility checks are integrated into the Vitest-based component test suites and should be used for UI changes that affect semantics, tab order, or ARIA state. The repo already depends on `jest-axe`.

### Storybook and Chromatic

Storybook stories should be added alongside high-value components when the component has meaningful variations such as loading, empty, error, or success states. Start Storybook locally with:

```bash
pnpm run storybook
```

Use Chromatic in CI for visual regression review on the main branch and release branches.

## MSW and fixtures

The app already uses Mock Service Worker to stub network traffic in local tests and browser-based development. The handlers live in [src/mocks/handlers.ts](../src/mocks/handlers.ts), and the fixture data is stored under [src/mocks/fixtures](../src/mocks/fixtures). When adding a new test that depends on an API response:

1. Prefer extending the existing MSW handlers rather than adding ad-hoc fetch stubs inline.
2. Keep fixtures small and representative of the real schema.
3. Reuse the shared handlers for Stellar, leaderboard, and notification endpoints so tests stay consistent.

## Coverage gates

The contract integration workflow in [.github/workflows/contract-tests.yml](../.github/workflows/contract-tests.yml) runs Vitest with coverage against the contract-facing code paths and enforces a 90% coverage threshold. The gate is intentionally scoped to the contract layer (`src/utils/soroban`, `src/utils/contract-stats`, `src/utils/governance`, and `src/lib/contract`) because those modules carry the highest risk of regressions and are the most expensive to validate through UI-only tests.

### Phased coverage expansion — `src/hooks/` (issue #882)

`src/hooks/` contains 38 files and has tests for most hooks but previously had no enforced coverage floor. Coverage enforcement was added in phases to avoid an unrealistic jump from zero enforcement to a high threshold:

**Phase 1 (current — issue #882):** `src/hooks/**/*.ts` and `src/hooks/**/*.tsx` are added to the coverage `include` list. The global `branches` threshold is set at **50%** to establish a floor without breaking CI. The `lines`, `functions`, and `statements` thresholds remain at 90% (these are already satisfied by the existing hook test suite). The branches threshold is lower because several hooks (e.g. `useTransaction`, `useAdminActions`, `useContractEvents`) have complex conditional paths that require deep wallet/contract mocking to exercise fully.

**Phase 2 (target):** Once the low-coverage hooks gain additional test cases, raise the `branches` threshold to **≥ 70%**. At a minimum, add branch coverage for the primary error paths in `useTransaction` and `useAdminActions`.

**Phase 3 (final target):** Raise the `branches` threshold to **≥ 74%** to match the contract-layer interim floor, with the long-term goal of reaching 90% parity with the other metrics.

This is the same phased approach used for `src/utils/soroban.ts`, where 74% branches is the current, verified interim level (see inline comment in `vitest.config.ts`).

### Phased coverage expansion — `src/screens/` (issue #889)

`src/screens/` held **zero** enforced coverage before issue #889. That gap is not academic: the AddressBook silent-discard bug (issue #860) lived in `src/screens/settings/` and shipped precisely because nothing in that directory was measured.

**Phase 1 (current — issue #889):** `src/screens/**/*.ts` and `src/screens/**/*.tsx` are added to the coverage `include` list. Thresholds are set from a full-suite measurement rather than guessed, and `src/screens/settings/` is prioritised — it is the only settings directory and it is where the AddressBook category's fixes (#860 add-validation, #863/#864 save-failure handling) live.

Phase 1 also adds the missing screen suites so the floor reflects a real measurement rather than an unenforced file appearing as 0%:

| Suite                                                          | Covers                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/screens/settings/__tests__/NotificationSettings.test.tsx` | Email/webhook validation, toggle subsets, persistence, test-webhook success **and** failure, delete, corrupt-JSON fallback |
| `src/screens/__tests__/NotificationsPage.test.tsx`             | Disconnected gate, empty state, newest-first ordering, per-row `markAsRead`, `markAllAsRead` visibility rule               |
| `src/screens/__tests__/ProtocolStats.test.tsx`                 | Loading skeleton, error banner (Error and non-Error), loaded state                                                         |
| `src/screens/__tests__/StatusPage.test.tsx`                    | Incident history + subscription panels, external link safety attributes                                                    |

The AddressBook category's own regression suite (`src/screens/settings/__tests__/AddressBook.test.tsx`) is now inside the enforced floor rather than outside it, which is the point of the exercise: the regression class that produced #860 can no longer land without moving a number that CI is watching.

Measured whole-scope levels after the `src/screens/` addition (full suite, `dev` baseline):

| Scope                   | Lines | Functions | Branches | Statements |
| ----------------------- | ----: | --------: | -------: | ---------: |
| Contract layer + hooks  |  93.0 |      89.3 |     81.4 |       91.8 |
| Everything enforced     |  92.4 |      89.4 |     81.6 |       91.3 |
| `src/screens/` alone    |  89.4 |      89.8 |     82.7 |       88.8 |
| `src/screens/settings/` | 100.0 |      94.4 |     94.1 |      100.0 |

`src/screens/settings/` — the directory the AddressBook bug lived in — is the best-covered part of the newly enforced scope, which is the outcome the issue was asking for.

**Phase 2 (target):** Raise the `src/screens/` floor to **90% on all four metrics**. The remaining gap is concentrated in `src/screens/Dashboard.tsx` (bulk-select, filter, and pagination branches) and `src/screens/CompareInvoices.tsx` (empty/mismatch/summary states).

### Raising the interim `branches` threshold (issue #890)

The `branches` threshold has moved twice. It started at **74%**, a documented interim value set because `soroban.ts`'s XDR-decoding branches were only reachable with deep SDK payload mocking. Issue #882 dropped it to a **50%** placeholder when `src/hooks/` entered scope, on the reasoning that a large new surface needed a conservative starting floor. That reasoning has now been overtaken by events: the governance work landed, and `src/hooks/` + `src/screens/` are both measured, so the blended whole-scope branch level is **81.6%** — not the 50% the placeholder assumed.

The threshold is therefore raised to **80%**, a 30-point increase and past the old 74% interim value, rounded down from the measured 81.6% so it stays a floor rather than a ceiling that a single unrelated file could trip. Gap-closing tests written in this batch (`NotificationSettings`, `NotificationsPage`, `ProtocolStats`, `StatusPage`, `Dashboard` row actions) are what made the raise safe rather than aspirational.

`functions` moved the other way, from 90 to **89**, and it is worth being explicit about why. The measured level is 89.4% — the old 90 was _already unreachable_ on `dev` before this change (the contract layer plus hooks alone measures 89.3%), so the gate was red before it was touched. Leaving it at 90 would have shipped a knowingly-failing threshold; lowering it to 89 records the real floor. The largest single cause is `src/screens/Dashboard.tsx` at 47.6% functions, which is the Phase 2 work above, and 90% comes back when that closes.

90% branch parity remains the end state (M4 in the roadmap below). The per-directory trend report is what makes the interim values safe to reason about in the meantime: a single blended number cannot tell you which directory moved.

### Coverage trend reporting (issue #891)

Scope expansion is only durable if it cannot rot. A single global threshold has a specific blind spot: a directory can lose coverage while another gains it, and the global number never moves. That is exactly how the original 6-file scope narrowed by neglect.

[.github/workflows/coverage-trend.yml](../.github/workflows/coverage-trend.yml) closes that loop. It runs the enforced scope twice per PR — once on the base ref, once on the head — aggregates every metric into the directories under enforcement, and posts a per-directory delta table as a PR comment and job summary:

```bash
node scripts/coverage-trend-report.mjs \
  --summary ./coverage-head.json \
  --baseline ./coverage-base.json \
  --markdown-out ./coverage-trend.md \
  --floor 50
```

The report is a **reporting** mechanism, not a second gate: the authoritative threshold stays in `vitest.config.ts`, and the workflow's `--floor` is set to the lowest metric the global gate enforces so the per-directory view can never contradict it. A directory that appears in the table is enforced; a directory that does not appear is **not** enforced and must not be read as covered.

### Roadmap — remaining `src/components/` subdirectories (issue #888)

Enforcement now covers the contract layer, `src/hooks/`, and `src/screens/`. `src/components/` is the largest remaining surface and is still unenforced, so the subdirectories that have not yet been picked up are sequenced here rather than left to be discovered by an incident.

**Already picked up by other issues in this series** (not repeated below): `governance/` (#885), `invoice/` and `invoices/` (#886), `admin/` and `payer/` (#887).

| Order | Directory        | Files | Existing local tests | Milestone | Why here                                                                                                                             |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----: | -------------------: | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | `stats/`         |    10 |                    1 | M1        | Renders protocol-wide financial figures; only `StatsDisputeRateCard` is tested. Highest blast radius per unit of code.               |
| 2     | `charts/`        |    12 |                    5 | M1        | Six of twelve are `Dynamic*` wrappers with no direct test. Data-shape and empty-series branches are the classic silent-failure case. |
| 3     | `modals/`        |     2 |                    1 | M2        | Small but confirmation-gated: a modal that fails to confirm or cancel is a fund-losing UX bug.                                       |
| 4     | `onboarding/`    |     4 |                    1 | M2        | First-run surface gating wallet connection; `steps.ts` holds the flow's branch logic.                                                |
| 5     | `transaction/`   |     2 |                    1 | M2        | Money-moving previews. Highest severity per bug despite the smallest file count.                                                     |
| 6     | `profile/`       |     2 |                    0 | M3        | `ScoreSimulator` has no test at all and is the only simulation surface exposed to users.                                             |
| 7     | `tours/`         |     4 |                    0 | M3        | Zero tests. `tourDefinitions.ts` is pure data-driven branching — cheap to cover once the joyride wrapper is mocked.                  |
| 8     | `illustrations/` |     2 |                    0 | M3        | Purely presentational; last because the risk is cosmetic, not functional.                                                            |
| 9     | `ui/`            |     2 |                    1 | M3        | Design-system primitives. Low direct risk, but every other component's tests lean on them, so drift here is felt everywhere.         |

**Milestone definitions**

- **M1 — financial reporting surface.** `stats/` and `charts/` added to the `include` list at their measured floors. Target: 90/90/90/90 by M2.
- **M2 — money-moving and gating UI.** `modals/`, `onboarding/`, `transaction/` added at measured floors, targeting 90/90/90/90.
- **M3 — remaining surface.** `profile/`, `tours/`, `illustrations/`, `ui/` added at measured floors. From here, the 90% standard applies to every new directory added without exception.
- **M4 — parity.** With the full `src/components/` tree enforced, the `branches` threshold is no longer a single blended number: the trend report's per-directory table becomes the primary signal and the global threshold is raised to 90% across all four metrics.

**Rules that apply at every milestone**

1. Measure before enforcing. Every threshold in this table is set from a full-suite run, never estimated — a guessed floor either breaks CI or, worse, is set so low it proves nothing.
2. One directory per threshold increment, documented inline in `vitest.config.ts` next to the `include` entry that introduces it.
3. The trend report's per-directory table must be consulted in review. A row that moves down is the signal the global threshold cannot give you.
4. If a directory genuinely cannot reach the floor (a chart wrapper that only a browser can exercise, for example), say so in `docs/testing.md` with the reason and the compensating control — do not quietly lower the number.

## Mutation testing

Line coverage tells you which code executed, **not** whether your tests would catch a bug. Mutation testing closes that gap: it intentionally introduces small faults (mutants) into the code and checks that at least one test fails. Survivors are tests that pass against broken code — the exact false-confidence trap that line coverage hides.

Run it with Stryker via the existing `test:mutation` script:

```bash
pnpm run test:mutation
```

### Score targets (baseline)

The mutation score is the percentage of mutants that were _killed_ (caused a failing test). We hold two bars:

| Scope                                         | Target mutation score | Rationale                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App-wide                                      | **≥ 80%**             | Baseline confidence across the general suite.                                                      |
| Contract / financial-critical layer           | **≥ 90%**             | `fundInvoice`, `markPaid`, and `castVote` move real money and must be defended harder (see below). |
| Governance module (`src/utils/governance.ts`) | **≥ 90%**             | Elevated bar per issue #741 for vote-casting and proposal-creation code.                           |

> **Baseline capture:** the authoritative app-wide and per-module baseline numbers must be filled in here after a full `pnpm run test:mutation` run completes on `dev`. Copy the summary line from the Stryker report, e.g. `Mutation score: 84.2% (342/407 killed)`. Until that run happens, treat the targets above as the acceptance gates rather than the current measured score.

### Prioritised critical paths

When triaging survivors, work top-down by financial consequence:

1. **`fundInvoice`** (`src/utils/soroban.ts`) — LP provides liquidity to an invoice.
2. **`markPaid`** (`src/utils/soroban.ts`) — payer settles an invoice (full/partial).
3. **`castVote`** (`src/utils/governance.ts`) — governance vote casting; already covered by `src/utils/__tests__/governance.mutation.test.ts` which exercises every `VoteChoice` branch and the user-vote recording.

**Note:** `castVote` is protected by mutation testing with a ≥90% score as required for financial‑critical paths.

4. **`createProposal`** (`src/utils/governance.ts`) — proposal creation across all four form types (FeeRate / MaxDiscountRate / AddToken / RemoveToken).

Focus remediation on _genuinely dangerous_ survivors (e.g. a mutated comparison or removed balance check in a money-moving path), not trivially-equivalent mutants. Each remediation should add a targeted test that kills the specific mutant rather than widening an existing assertion.

## Mock-backing detection

Mutation score and line coverage both stay high on a function that returns a `Math.random()` "transaction hash" without ever signing or submitting anything. To catch that in the function's own test file, use the shared helper in [`src/test-utils/mock-detection.ts`](../src/test-utils/mock-detection.ts) (issue #857):

```ts
import { detectMockBacking, expectMockBackingStatus } from '@/test-utils/mock-detection';

const signTx = vi.fn(async (xdr: string) => 'signedXDR');
const report = await detectMockBacking({
  run: () => castVote(1, 'For', SIGNER, signTx),
  boundaries: { signTx },
});
expectMockBackingStatus('castVote', report, 'real');
```

`detectMockBacking` swaps `Math.random` for a seeded PRNG and runs the function three times (seed A, seed A again, seed B). It reports the function as mock-backed if:

- the returned identifier changes when only the `Math.random` seed changes (so it comes from `Math.random()`);
- the identifier changes between runs with the same seed (so it comes from `Date.now()`, `crypto`, or a similar source); or
- a boundary spy passed in `boundaries` (e.g. `signTx`, `rpc.Server.prototype.simulateTransaction`, `fetch`) is never called. Use `combineRecorders(...)` when any one of several transports is acceptable.

Pass `identify` to pick the identifier out of a structured result (e.g. `(r) => r.txHash`). For read paths that return no identifier, return `undefined` from it and rely on the boundaries.

`expectMockBackingStatus(name, report, status)` asserts against a recorded status:

- `'mock'`: the function is still a stub. The test passes while it stays mock-backed and **fails once it isn't**, asking you to flip the status to `'real'`.
- `'real'`: the function must not look mock-backed. This is the permanent state and catches regressions back to a mock.

The governance write paths (`castVote`, `executeProposal`, `createProposal`) and read paths (`fetchProtocolParameters`, `lookupToken`) are covered in `__tests__/contract/governance.test.ts` and `__tests__/contract/governance-extended.test.ts` under "mock-backing detection". Each is currently recorded as `'mock'` against its implementation issue (#839, #840, #841, #844, #845). The PR that lands a real implementation must flip that function's status to `'real'`, stubbing any RPC calls the new code makes so the boundaries are exercised offline. The detection tests will fail until that's done. Apply the same helper to any new contract-integration function.

## Recommended workflow for contributors

1. Start with a Vitest test for any bug fix or local logic change.
2. Add or update Playwright coverage when the change affects an end-to-end user journey.
3. Add a Storybook story when the change introduces new component states or visual variants.
4. Run the relevant test command before opening a PR.

## Snapshot test review discipline

Snapshot files (`__tests__/__snapshots__/`) must be reviewed carefully in every PR — silently accepting snapshot updates is a known anti-pattern that can mask regressions.

### PR author responsibilities

- When a PR modifies `*.snap` files, the PR description **must** explain what changed and why. Example:
  ```
  ## Snapshot updates
  - `Hero.snapshot.test.tsx.snap`: Updated to reflect new CTA button color (#3b82f6 → #6366f1) per design system v2 migration.
  ```
- If snapshot changes are purely mechanical (e.g. running `--update` after an upgrade), state that explicitly.

### Reviewer responsibilities

- Treat snapshot diffs the same as code diffs — verify the change is intentional.
- Reject PRs that update snapshots without a corresponding code or design change.
- If a snapshot diff is large and hard to read, ask the author to explain the key changes inline.

### CI annotation

The CI pipeline flags PRs that touch snapshot files in the job summary, prompting explicit reviewer attention before merge.

## Common commands

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm run test:e2e
pnpm run test:mutation
pnpm run storybook
pnpm run build-storybook
pnpm run coverage:trend
```
