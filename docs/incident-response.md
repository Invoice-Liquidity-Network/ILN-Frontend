# Frontend Security Incident Response Process

This document defines the official incident response process specifically for the **ILN-Frontend** web application.

Because ILN is a live financial application interacting with Soroban smart contracts and user wallets, frontend-side security threats (such as compromised npm package updates, malicious CDN script injections, DNS hijacking, or fake transaction-signing prompts) require rapid, specialized containment strategies distinct from contract-level incident response.

## 1. Scope & Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level                    | Impact Description                                                                                                   | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SEV-1 (Critical)**     | Direct risk to user funds, private keys, or wallet transactions. Malicious transaction payload generation.           | - Compromised dependency injecting malicious Soroban tx XDR into signing prompts.<br>- Malicious CDN script stealing session context or hijacking wallet interactions.<br>- Compromised Vercel deployment active in production. |
| **SEV-2 (High)**         | Disruption of core frontend features, high-risk XSS, or unauthorized data exposure without direct fund manipulation. | - Stored XSS vulnerability on invoice detail page.<br>- Spoofed wallet connection status.<br>- Indexer API endpoint returning malicious links.                                                                                  |
| **SEV-3 (Medium / Low)** | Cosmetic UI degradation, low-impact dependency vulnerability, non-critical API failure.                              | - Minor dependency CVE without exploit path.<br>- Non-sensitive CORS misconfiguration.                                                                                                                                          |

---

## 2. Emergency Escalation & Contact Matrix

When a frontend security incident is detected, immediately notify the Incident Response Team via the following escalation chain:

| Role                        | Contact Channel                    | Responsibility                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incident Commander (IC)** | Lead Maintainer / `#sec-incidents` | Leads response effort, coordinates containment decisions.              |
| **Frontend Lead**           | `@frontend-leads`                  | Executes Vercel rollbacks, feature flag kill-switches, and code fixes. |
| **Smart Contract Lead**     | `@contract-leads`                  | Evaluates on-chain impact and triggers contract pause if necessary.    |
| **Communications Lead**     | `@comms-lead`                      | Publishes user advisories and updates status page. See [Status Page Runbook](./status-page-runbook.md) for the verified update procedure and rehearsal checklist (#705). |

---

### Cross-Repository Coordination

For incidents that reach the contract, indexer, or notifications services, follow the [cross-repository incident coordination protocol](./cross-repo-incident-coordination.md). It defines acknowledgement targets, required handoff evidence, and the contract-pause to frontend-maintenance-banner sequence.

The smart-contract repository owns the [indexer incident runbook](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract/blob/dev/docs/indexer-incident-runbook.md) and [monitoring runbook](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract/blob/dev/docs/monitoring-runbook.md). Frontend maintainers must link the shared incident record when escalating rather than duplicate those procedures.

---

## 3. Containment & Mitigation Procedures

### Step 1: Execute Feature Flag Kill-Switches

For incidents isolated to specific frontend features (e.g. stub features, oracle feeds, or insurance pools), disable affected functionality immediately via environment variables without full app shutdown:

- **Disable Insurance Pool**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSURANCE_POOL_ENABLED=false`
- **Disable Oracle Verification**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_ENABLED=false`
- **Disable Invoice NFT Display**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_ENABLED=false`

To apply in Vercel:

```bash
# Update environment variable via Vercel CLI
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_INSURANCE_POOL_ENABLED production false
# Trigger immediate redeployment
vercel --prod
```

### Step 2: Emergency Vercel Rollback (SEV-1 Mitigation)

If a malicious build or compromised supply chain dependency is deployed to production:

1. **Identify the Last Known Safe Deployment ID**:
   ```bash
   vercel ls --prod
   ```
2. **Execute Instant Rollback**:
   ```bash
   vercel rollback <SAFE_DEPLOYMENT_ID>
   ```
3. **Alternatively, Roll Back via Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to **Vercel Project Dashboard** -> **Deployments**.
   - Locate the last known good deployment (verified git commit hash).
   - Click **...** -> **Promote to Production**.

### Step 3: DNS Maintenance Page & Emergency Lockout

If the origin domain or CDN is compromised:

1. Route traffic to static emergency maintenance page hosted on an isolated, safe CDN.
2. Invalidate all active Supabase session tokens and client cache states if session hijacking is suspected.

## 3.5 Frontend Incident Mitigation Decision Tree

Not every frontend bug warrants a full Vercel rollback (which reverts *all* recent changes, including unrelated fixes). Use this decision tree to choose the appropriate mitigation strategy based on bug scope, urgency, and blast radius.

### Mitigation Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | When to Use | Time to Mitigate | Blast Radius | Recovery Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **Feature Flag Disable** | Bug is isolated to a gated feature (insurance pool, oracle, NFT display) | 2-5 minutes (env var update + redeploy) | Single feature only | Instant (no code revert) | Fastest option; requires feature to be flag-gated. No impact on unrelated fixes. |
| **Targeted Hotfix** | Bug is app-wide but fix is simple and low-risk (e.g., UI regression, API endpoint typo) | 15-30 minutes (fix + CI + deploy) | Entire app | 5-10 minutes (deploy time) | Preserves other recent changes. Requires CI checks to pass. |
| **Full Vercel Rollback** | SEV-1 incidents, compromised build, or hotfix is too risky/complex | 1-2 minutes (instant rollback) | Reverts ALL recent changes | Depends on re-deploy speed | Safest option for critical incidents but loses all progress since last safe deployment. |

### Timing Data from Rehearsals

The following timings are based on rehearsal exercises (Issues #22 and #23):

- **Feature flag disable**: 2-5 minutes from decision to production deployment
  - Vercel CLI env var update: ~30 seconds
  - Automatic redeploy trigger: ~1-2 minutes
  - DNS propagation: not required (same deployment)

- **Targeted hotfix**: 15-30 minutes from decision to production deployment
  - Code fix implementation: 5-10 minutes
  - CI checks (lint, tests, build): 5-10 minutes
  - Vercel deploy: 2-5 minutes
  - Smoke test verification: 3-5 minutes

- **Full Vercel rollback**: 1-2 minutes from decision to production
  - Identify safe deployment ID: ~30 seconds
  - Execute rollback: ~30 seconds
  - Verification: ~30 seconds

### Decision Checklist

Before choosing a mitigation strategy, confirm:

1. **Bug scope assessment**
   - [ ] Can the bug be isolated to a single feature?
   - [ ] Is that feature behind a feature flag?
   - [ ] Does the bug affect core wallet/signing flows?

2. **Hotfix feasibility**
   - [ ] Is the fix simple (single file, <10 lines)?
   - [ ] Does the fix require new dependencies or complex logic?
   - [ ] Can CI checks pass within 10 minutes?

3. **Rollback impact assessment**
   - [ ] What other fixes will be lost if we rollback?
   - [ ] Is the last known safe deployment verified?
   - [ ] Will rollback introduce regressions (e.g., contract ID changes)?

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario A: Insurance pool UI shows incorrect calculation**
- **Scope**: Isolated to insurance pool feature
- **Mitigation**: Feature flag disable (`NEXT_PUBLIC_INSURANCE_POOL_ENABLED=false`)
- **Time**: 3 minutes
- **Blast radius**: Insurance pool only

**Scenario B: Wallet connection fails for all users**
- **Scope**: App-wide, core functionality
- **Mitigation**: Full rollback (hotfix too risky for core wallet flow)
- **Time**: 2 minutes
- **Blast radius**: All recent changes reverted

**Scenario C: Invoice detail page shows broken layout due to CSS typo**
- **Scope**: App-wide but low-risk fix
- **Mitigation**: Targeted hotfix (single CSS line fix)
- **Time**: 18 minutes
- **Blast radius**: None (preserves other changes)

## 4. Intersection with Smart Contract Incident Response

A compromised frontend interface may attempt to trick users into signing malicious Soroban transactions targeting un-compromised smart contracts.

When a frontend incident intersects with smart contract execution:

1. **Transaction Simulation Audit**: Inspect raw transaction XDRs generated by the compromised frontend version to identify target contract functions and attacker wallet addresses.
2. **Contract Pause Protocol**: If malicious transactions are actively executing on-chain due to user manipulation:
   - Contact the Smart Contract Emergency Multisig team.
   - Cross-reference the smart contract repo's emergency pause procedure (`contracts/invoice-escrow/src/lib.rs` emergency pause functions).
   - Trigger protocol-level contract pause to halt invoice funding and settlements while the frontend is secured.
3. **Verification Before Unpausing**: Ensure clean frontend build hash confirmation prior to unpausing smart contract execution.

## 6. Post-Incident Review & Supply Chain Hardening

Following any security incident:

1. Conduct a post-mortem review within 72 hours.
2. Perform a complete dependency audit: `pnpm audit` and `git diff pnpm-lock.yaml`.
3. Verify all external script hashes and lockfile integrity.

### 6.1 Supply-Chain Compromise Detection Mechanisms

The following automated checks run in CI (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to detect compromised or malicious dependencies before they reach production:

#### **npm audit**

- **Trigger:** Every pull request and pre-merge to `main`/`dev`
- **Command:** `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
- **Purpose:** Detects known CVEs in published package versions
- **Limitation:** Only catches **published** vulnerabilities; does not catch 0-days or a new malicious version of a trusted package
- **Response:** Audit failures block merges; maintainers must investigate and either bump to a patched version, apply a lockfile override, or accept documented risk

#### **Postinstall Script Monitoring**

- **Trigger:** Every `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in CI
- **Detection:** The CI workflow runs a script to flag any direct dependencies with `postinstall` or `install` scripts
- **Purpose:** Identifies packages that execute arbitrary code during installation—a common supply-chain attack signature
- **Investigation:** For suspicious packages, review:
  - The package's recent version history and release notes
  - GitHub repo commit history (if available) for unusual commits
  - The exact script contents in `node_modules/<package>/package.json`
  - Whether the script was present in previously-pinned versions (check `pnpm-lock.yaml`)

#### **Dependency Lockfile Review**

- **Manual audit:** Before each release, maintainers review `git diff pnpm-lock.yaml` for:
  - New transitive dependencies
  - Version bumps with unusual or undocumented changes
  - Changes to `prebuiltBinaries` entries (binaries with install scripts)
  - Addition of new Git-based dependencies (higher compromise risk than npm registry)

#### **Sentry Error Tracking (Issue #706)**

- **Integration:** `@sentry/nextjs` is wired into all runtime contexts (client, server, edge) via `sentry.*.config.ts`
- **Signing-path alert:** Any error on `/i/[id]`, `/api/sign-transaction`, or `/api/submit-transaction` triggers an immediate P1 page — a single error on these paths is treated as a potential SEV-1
- **Source maps:** Uploaded at build time and deleted from the public CDN; stack traces resolve to TypeScript source lines in Sentry
- **CSP integration:** CSP violation reports (Issue #24) are forwarded to Sentry as `security_report` events — both error classes feed a unified detection pipeline
- **Full setup guide:** See [Sentry Integration](./sentry-integration.md)

#### **Incident Detection & Response**

If a compromised dependency is detected post-merge:

1. **Immediate action:** Revert the offending commit(s) or revoke the compromised version via `npm deprecate`
2. **User communication:** Publish SEV-1 advisory (see Template A above) recommending users clear caches and refresh
3. **Vercel rollback:** Roll back to the last verified safe deployment
4. **Forensic audit:** Inspect all transactions signed via the compromised version and monitor for malicious on-chain activity
5. **Contract pause:** If compromised Soroban transactions are detected, coordinate with Smart Contract Leads to pause the affected contract function
