# Frontend Architecture Overview

This document describes the current structure, data flow, and library choices for the Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN) frontend. It is intentionally concise: enough context for contributors to understand where changes belong without duplicating implementation details from every route.

---

## System Shape

ILN is a Next.js App Router frontend for a Stellar/Soroban invoice liquidity protocol. The UI is organized around the protocol's main actors: freelancers submit invoices, liquidity providers fund them, payers settle or dispute them, governance users vote on proposals, and admins monitor protocol health.

## Route Surface

The primary route tree lives in `app/`. A small legacy `src/app/` tree still exists for older route experiments/tests and should be treated carefully when moving code.

```

```

## Data Flow

### Reads

Most contract and indexer reads flow through hooks:

1. A route or component calls a hook such as `useInvoices`, `useBalances`, `useContractStats`, `useRecentProtocolFeed`, or a hook under `src/hooks/queries/`.
2. The hook uses TanStack React Query for loading state, cache keys, refetch intervals, and invalidation.
3. Contract reads call `src/utils/soroban.ts` or `src/lib/*` helpers to simulate Soroban reads, parse XDR/ScVal data, query Horizon, or call an indexer endpoint.
4. Components receive typed data and render tables, cards, charts, badges, and dashboards.

### Writes

User-approved contract writes coordinate wallet state, transaction builders, and toasts:

1. The user triggers an action such as submit, fund, pay, mark paid, cancel, dispute, vote, delegate, or transfer.
2. A hook or utility builds and simulates the Soroban transaction.
3. `WalletContext` requests a Freighter signature and verifies the configured Stellar network.
4. The signed XDR is submitted and polled until resolution.
5. Sonner toasts communicate pending/success/error states, and React Query invalidates affected invoice, balance, stats, or governance queries.

### Server Routes

API routes are used for server-only integration points:

- `app/api/reminders/route.ts` reads Supabase reminder preferences and sends Resend emails when authorized by `CRON_SECRET`.
- `app/api/reminders/unsubscribe/route.ts` updates reminder preferences.
- `app/api/feedback/route.ts` can create GitHub issues from app feedback when GitHub credentials are configured.
- `app/api/auth/challenge.ts` and `app/api/auth/verify.ts` support SEP-10-style auth helpers.
- `app/api/notifications/[address]/route.ts` bridges notification reads by address.

## State, Providers, and UI Boundaries

- `app/Providers.tsx` wires global providers, React Query, theme behavior, toasts, and local MSW startup when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCKING=enabled`.
- `WalletContext` owns wallet address, provider state, network checks, role detection, balances, and signing.
- `NotificationContext` stores in-app notification history.
- `ToastContext` wraps toast behavior while `AppToaster` renders the Sonner host.
- `KeyboardShortcutsContext` manages keyboard shortcut state and global keydown listeners.
- Page routes should compose feature components and hooks; reusable components should stay under `src/components/`.
- Stellar SDK and RPC details should stay in `src/utils/soroban.ts`, `src/lib/`, or focused hooks rather than being called directly from presentational components.

### Context vs Hooks Boundary

- **`src/context/`** — React Context providers and their consumer hooks (e.g., `WalletProvider` + `useWallet`,
  `ToastProvider` + `useToast`, `NotificationProvider` + `useNotification`,
  `KeyboardShortcutsProvider` + `useKeyboardShortcuts`). Context files own _shared global state_ that must
  be available to the entire subtree. If a file exports a `*Provider` or calls `createContext`, it belongs here.

- **`src/hooks/`** — Custom React hooks that do NOT define new contexts. They may consume context hooks
  to derive or transform state, manage local (component-level) state, wrap external APIs, or encapsulate
  effect-heavy logic. If a file exports only hook functions (that consume context or are pure utilities),
  it belongs here.

### Naming Conventions

- `useToast` — always imported from `@/context/ToastContext` (the former re-export `@/hooks/useToast` has been removed).
- `useWallet` — always imported from `@/context/WalletContext` for basic wallet state.
- `useAuthenticatedWallet` — imported from `@/hooks/useAuthenticatedWallet` for the SEP-10 auth layer on top of `WalletContext`.
- `useNotification` (singular) — always imported from `@/context/NotificationContext` for in-app notification items.
- `useBrowserNotifications` (plural) — imported from `@/hooks/useBrowserNotifications` for the browser Notification API (permissions, desktop notifications).

### Avoiding Duplicate Polling & State

Invoice status changes are the primary source of duplication risk. To keep RPC usage predictable:

1. **React Query is the single source of truth** for contract reads. Hooks should prefer `useQuery`-based data
   over direct contract calls to avoid bypassing cache and creating redundant network requests.
2. **Notification polling** (`useNotificationEvents`, `usePositionPolling`) should share a single
   invoice-change detection loop. Do not add a third polling hook that independently calls `getInvoice()`.
3. **LocalStorage-derived state** (bookmarks, watchlist, address book, LP settings, widget layout)
   is acceptable per-hook, but state computations should not duplicate logic already present in context providers.

## Environment Model

The canonical local template is `.env.local.example`. Direct env references in `app/` and `src/` are checked by:

```bash
pnpm run env:check
```

The CI workflow runs the same command, and `.env.local.example.allowlist` documents runtime-provided values such as `NODE_ENV`.

Client-visible configuration uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, including Stellar network settings, feature flags, indexer URLs, WalletConnect project ID, app URL/version, and contract version labels. Server-only secrets such as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `SEP10_SERVER_SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, and GitHub feedback credentials must never be exposed with a public prefix.

## Library Rationale

- **Next.js App Router**: Fits route-level product areas, server API routes, PWA/offline behavior, and deployable static/client-heavy surfaces.
- **TanStack React Query**: Provides structured cache keys, query invalidation after wallet transactions, polling controls for live protocol state, and optimistic update patterns.
- **i18next, react-i18next, and next-intl**: Support existing locale files and leave room for route-aware internationalized UI.
- **next-pwa**: Generates the service worker and offline support used by `app/offline/` and public PWA assets.
- **next-themes**: Keeps theme state centralized for the light/dark design system.
- **Sonner**: Gives mutation flows concise pending/success/error toast updates without heavyweight styling.
- **Supabase JS and Resend**: Power opt-in payer reminder persistence and email delivery behind server-only env gates.
- **Recharts**: Used for stats, analytics, yield, reputation, allocation, and volume visualizations.
- **jspdf, papaparse, qrcode, and qrcode.react**: Cover invoice PDF generation, CSV import/export support, and invoice sharing flows.
- **Storybook, Chromatic, Vitest, Playwright, jest-axe, and Stryker**: Cover component documentation, visual regression, unit/accessibility tests, browser journeys, and mutation testing.

## Contributor Guidance

When adding a route, update this document and the README route summary if the product surface changes. When adding an env var, update `.env.local.example` or `.env.local.example.allowlist` in the same change and run `pnpm run env:check`.
