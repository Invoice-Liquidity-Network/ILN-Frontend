# Governance Mock-Closure Regression — Retrospective

> **ILN Frontend Post-Mortem — Governance write paths closed as "live" while still mocked**
>
> - **Date of Incident:** 2026-08-25 (issues closed) · detected 2026-09-22
> - **Severity:** Process incident. No user funds moved; governance votes, executions and proposals submitted through the UI were silently not recorded on-chain.
> - **Root Cause:** Issues whose titles claimed a mock had been _replaced_ were closed automatically by a PR merge (`Closes #…`) without anyone checking the diff against the issue's specific claim. The merged PR only wired a read path, and its own doc change still marked the write paths **Stubbed**. The test workflows that could have raised doubts do not run on PRs into `dev`.
> - **Timeline:**
>   - `2026-07-29`: #517 ("Wire real governance contract calls to replace `governance.ts` stubs") closed by PR #604, which consolidated governance call sites but left the write paths mocked.
>   - `2026-08-24`: Epic #650 opened with #651 (`castVote`), #652 (`createProposal`), #653 (`delegateVotingPower`) and siblings.
>   - `2026-08-25 01:32 UTC`: PR #670 ("fixed governance") merged into `dev` with 0 reviews. It closed #650–#653 but only replaced `fetchProposals` with a Soroban `list_proposals` read. Its edit to `contract-integration-status.md` marked `castVote`, `createProposal` and `delegateVotingPower` as **Stubbed**.
>   - `2026-08-26`: #661 ("Update … integration status doc after governance goes live") closed with no linked PR.
>   - `2026-09-22`: Audit batch #839–#859 filed after `castVote`, `executeProposal` and `createProposal` were found still returning `Math.random()` hashes and never calling `signTx`.
>   - `2026-09-25`: The pattern recurred during remediation (see [Recurrence](#recurrence-during-remediation)).
> - **Preventative Measures Added:** See [Fixes from this category](#fixes-from-this-category).

This follows the post-mortem convention in [incident-response.md § Template C](incident-response.md#template-c-post-mortem--incident-summary), expanded with the contributing-factor analysis this incident needs. It is blameless: the gap is in the process, not in any one contributor.

## Impact

- **`castVote`**, **`executeProposal`** and **`createProposal`** (`src/utils/governance.ts`) sleep for 2–2.5 s, mutate the in-memory `MOCK_PROPOSALS` array, and return a `Math.random()` hex string as a transaction hash. The `_signTx` callback is accepted but never called, so the wallet is never asked to sign.
- **`fetchProtocolParameters`** and **`lookupToken`** return hard-coded values without any RPC or Horizon call.
- The governance UI (`app/governance/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/governance/new/page.tsx`) is not behind a feature flag. Users got a success toast and a plausible-looking hash for a vote or proposal that never reached the chain, and the effect disappeared on reload.
- `docs/testing.md` describes `castVote` as a path that "moves real money" and sets its coverage bar on that basis (#867). `docs/contract-integration-status.md` correctly lists the governance writes as Stubbed. But it cites line numbers and functions (`delegateVotingPower`, `getGovTokenBalance`, `getQuorumThreshold`, `getProposalHistory`) that no longer exist in `src/`, so it wasn't reliable enough for anyone to use as a check (#846).

No funds were at risk because governance writes never touched the chain. The harm was to trust: users, contributors and reviewers relied on a "done" signal that was false for about four weeks.

## Root cause

**An issue was treated as fixed because the PR that referenced it merged, not because the diff did what the issue claimed.**

PR #670's description is accurate about what it changed (a live `list_proposals` read, status parsing, a new contract-ID constant). Its own edit to `contract-integration-status.md` also correctly kept `castVote`, `createProposal` and `delegateVotingPower` as **Stubbed**. But its `Closes #650 / #651 / #652 / #653` lines closed three issues whose titles each said one of those write mocks would be _replaced_. The contradiction was inside a single PR. Closing via keyword needs no check that the claim holds, and nobody made one.

## Contributing factors

1. **The test suite does not run on PRs into `dev`.** `ci.yml`, `contract-tests.yml`, `e2e-tests.yml` and most other workflows trigger on `branches: [main, develop]`. The integration branch is `dev`, and no `develop` branch exists. PR #670's only checks were the issue-link check, the wave-points summary and the size labeller, and two of those three failed. "Green CI" was never available as a signal here, and nobody noticed it was missing.
2. **Existing tests asserted shape, not behaviour.** Governance tests checked `typeof hash === 'string'` and `hash.length > 0`. A `Math.random()` string passes both, and coverage and mutation-score gates (#741) reward the mock as much as a real implementation. Nothing checked that `signTx` was called or that the hash came from the network.
3. **Ambiguous issue titles.** "Replace X mock with live integration" reads as done once closed. Nothing separated an issue that _implements_ a real call from one that _documents or plans_ it (#855).
4. **The status doc was right but not trusted.** `contract-integration-status.md` said Stubbed, but its line references and function names had drifted from the code, so nobody used it as a check. A per-function status verified against code (#846) is only useful if reviewers consult it when an issue closes.
5. **Batch closure.** One PR closing an epic and three sub-issues makes it easy to miss that most of them got no change.
6. **Code comments contradicted the closed issues, but nothing read them.** The `TODO: Replace with actual Soroban transaction … Ref: #111` comments and the underscore-prefixed `_signTx` / `_signerAddress` parameters stayed in place after closure (#851). A reviewer comparing the diff with the issue would have seen them.

## Recurrence during remediation

While this category was open, PR #987 (merged 2026-09-25) closed four documentation issues. For two of them the diff does not do what the issue asks:

- **#867** asked for `docs/testing.md` to be _corrected_ so it no longer says `castVote` moves real money. The PR instead **added** "`castVote` is protected by mutation testing with a ≥90% score as required for financial‑critical paths." That repeats the false premise, and `src/utils/__tests__/governance.mutation.test.ts` currently has failing cases on `dev`.
- **#868** asked for a formal decision on GraphQL. The PR's diff contains no GraphQL change.

This shows the root cause is live, not historical. The controls below are what would catch it; until #854 lands, reviewers should re-read the linked issue against the diff before merging.

## What went well

- The gap was found by reading code against issue claims, not by users reporting lost votes. Mock-backed writes on a governance surface are the kind of defect that can go unnoticed for a long time.
- The audit produced narrow, single-purpose follow-ups (one per function, one per control) instead of one "fix governance" epic, which is what went wrong the first time.
- The read path that #670 did deliver (`fetchProposals` → `list_proposals`) is real and tested at the SDK boundary.

## Residual risk

- Until #839–#841 land, governance writes stay mock-backed and reachable in the UI. #850's indicator is the interim mitigation.
- Until the workflow triggers include `dev`, none of the new detection tests (#847, #848, #857) run on the PRs they are meant to gate. They only run locally, via `pnpm run verify` and the pre-push hook, or on the promotion PR to `main`.
- Closing via keyword stays enabled. The PR template item (#854) is a human check and can be skipped under time pressure, as #987 showed.

## Lessons

1. **Closing an issue is a claim about the code; check it against the code.** When a PR closes an issue that says "replace", "implement real" or "wire live", confirm the specific mock pattern (random hash, `MOCK_*` mutation, unused signer parameter) is gone from the diff.
2. **Look at which checks actually ran.** A PR with no test workflow in its checks list has no CI signal, whatever colour the badge is.
3. **Test the boundary, not the shape.** For contract-integration code, assert that the signer and transport were called and that returned identifiers come from them.
4. **Docs follow code, and reviewers read them.** Status docs should be updated from a code check, never from issue state. When a PR's doc change contradicts its `Closes` lines, the doc wins and the keyword comes out.
